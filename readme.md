# The Brazil Nut Simulator

This project is to test if the Brazil Nut Effect also emerges on a crude simulation.

The simulation is not meant to be precise and was done in a spam of a day. So you are bound to find some bugs and jiggling. A lot of jiggling actually.

## What?

The Brazil Nut effect is an effect that occurs when you have different sized objects on a container where bigger, heavier objects tend to stay in the top rather than in the bottom.

I was inspired by a video from the channel [It's Okay To Be Smart](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH4BNI0-FOK2dMXoFtViWHw).

For more details on the effect, watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEB8SKkBCxA

Also, I'm nuts and from Brazil. Fitting right? :)
